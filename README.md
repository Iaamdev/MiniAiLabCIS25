# MiniAiLabCIS25
A class project

## Description
Created a To-Do program based off of created UML and Sequence Diagram

## How to Compile (In Terminal)
g++ List.cpp Task.cpp main.cpp -o ToDoList

## Run
./ToDoList

## Lesson's Learned
### 1
I believe that group A's code seemed to be cleaner due to us giving the AI more direct guidelines for what we wanted to create.

### 2
Group A needed fewer iterations of AI request as we had less errors to deal with. We were able to understand exactly where the code producted the error and how to fix it. Unfortunately, we did not have time to fix the error.

### 3
What suprised us the most about this lab was how the AI writes code depending on given information. When group A had more of a structure for the AI, the narrow scope given from the group, seemingly made it easy for it to write the code. Group B had to consistantly had errors which required the group to ask multiple time to fix it. (leading to more errors)

### 4
Without a doubt, I would use the method of that of A. The AI has a more narrow scope so that it will product less (or more manageable) errors that a programmer could easily fix and get it to run.
